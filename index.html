<p> Electronic engineering technicians are involved in many aspects of design, development, testing and manufacturing.
They solve problems that may appear in areas of research, manufacturing, sales, construction, inspection and maintenance.
Their work is specialized in applications while using learned principles of mathematics, science and engineering.
This work is most often performed when assisting other scientists or engineers, especially in areas of development and research.</p>
